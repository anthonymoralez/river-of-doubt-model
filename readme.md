## River of Doubt
A river in Brasil that was first explored by the [Rondon-Roosevelt Scientific Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt%E2%80%93Rondon_Scientific_Expedition). It is also the title of a book by Candace Miller about that expedition. And this repo is some ruby code that models a [board game design](http://blog.anthonymoralez.com/river%20of%20doubt) that I'm working on with the theme of that expedition.

dicetest.rb: Model of how the dice work.
illnesstest.rb: models the whole game, with some levers for tweaking the number of distribution of cards in the decks.
